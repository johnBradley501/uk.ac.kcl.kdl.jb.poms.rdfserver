<p>A basic OWL (<a
href="https://www.w3.org/OWL/">https://www.w3.org/OWL/</a>) ontology has
been developed which describes the data structure of the PoMS rdf
repository.&nbsp; Its URI is:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.poms.ac.uk/rdf/ontology">https://www.poms.ac.uk/rdf/ontology#</a></p>

<p>In this part of the PoMS rdf documentation
we present an overall semantic conception for PoMS’s ontology. </p>

<p>As mentioned elsewhere, PoMS can be
classified as a &quot;factoid prosopography&quot; and thus follows the main
principles of the factoid prosopography approach described at <u><a href="http://factoid-dighum.kcl.ac.uk/">http://factoid-dighum.kcl.ac.uk/</a></u>.
Thus, PoMS’s ontology draws on important components of the ontology for factoid
prosopography (FPO) presented there. See a description of this
connection in the Class Hierarchy section, below.</p>

<p>This documentation for the ontology is divided into three parts. </p>

<ul>
 <li>First, in the section entitled
     “Overview” there is a very brief description of PoMS's data model, which
     underpins its ontology.</li>
 <li>Then, in the class hierarchy section,
     one gets an overall level view of the classes in PoMS’s ontology with
     information about what the meanings of PoMS’s classes are, and how these
     classes are interconnected through subclassing.</li>
 <li>The next section (entitled &quot;Class
     Relationships&quot;) presents data relationships (what OWL calls “object
     properties”) that make up the relationships between PoMS's classes.</li>
 <li>In addition, a set of HTML pages have
     been generated from the owl file that present it in a somewhat more human-readable
     form.&nbsp; It contains information about all the data in the owl file,
     thus, not only the “object property” and subclassing characteristics (which are
     described here), but the other properties that take strings and numbers as values and
     that represent other kinds of data for PoMS’s classes (what owl calls
     “data properties”) as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can find this <u><a
     href="../ontology/doc/index.html" target="_blank">here</a></u>.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>PoMS's RDF data is a representation of the
structured data model upon which PoMS's database was created, and which in turn
is based on the factoid model. Thus, to understand PoMS's ontology, it is
useful to first understand the simplified data structure diagram that is shown
in the introduction to the FPO ontology at <a
href="http://factoid-dighum.kcl.ac.uk/">http://factoid-dighum.kcl.ac.uk/</a>
and is shown here:</p>

<p>
<img border=0 width=679 height=310 id="Picture 2" src="https://factoid-dighum.kcl.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/101/2016/12/factoid-model-4.png"></p>

<p>The central object in the figure is the <i>factoid</i>,
and as the text accompanying this figure there says, “A factoid is a spot in a
source that says something about a person or persons”, and a little later that
&quot;the factoid acts as a structural nexus that connects together historical
sources, persons (and person assemblages acting as persons), places and
possessions, and various kinds of classification schemes (such as personal
relationships, titles and offices, etc).&quot; Factoids are assertions made by
historical sources about historical people. The ironic character of the name
“factoid” is intentional. Historians well understand that rather direct
statements of the kinds represented might well overly simplify what might be a subtle
and complex reality.</p>

<p>The structure shown here is simplified in
various respects from the one that was actually used in the Factoid Ontology
itself and in PoMS. Even so, it represents something important about the structure
of PoMS data, and you can see this overarching structure, incorporated into
PoMS's ontology, and thus shown in both the ontology's class hierarchy and
class relationship diagrams presented below. Furthermore, PoMS’s ontologyshares
some of its structure and semantics with the more general Factoid
Prosopography.  Thus, the PoMS ontology explicitly connects some of its
entities to appropriate FPO entities.</p>

<h3 id="class-hier">PoMS ontology class hierarchy</h3>
<p>The figure below presents much of the PoMS
Ontology’s SubClass hierarchy as shown in the ontology editing software
Protégé.&nbsp;The SubClass idea in Ontologies is to some extent hierarchial,
and this figure emphasises this characteristic.  However, in the figure, many
classes that have subclasses are not “opened”, so that their subclasses are not
on display.  Bear this in mind while reading the overview below.  Furthermore,
remember that in an OWL Ontology like PoMS’s any class may appear as a subclass
of more than one parent class. Finally, as one would expect from an OWL-based
ontology like PoMS’s, all classes are subclasses of <i>owl:Thing</i>.</p>

<img src="images/classes.png" style="margin: 20px" align="left"/>

<p>As we begin our examination of the class
structure shown in this figure, it is useful to observe that the class
structure shown here can be conveniently broken down into three parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>items 
under :ThingWithID constitute classes that primarily represent the structure of
PoMS’s relational database,</li>

<li>other
classes with names starting “:Thing…” represent important substructures of
properties that are shared by various classes, and</li>

<li>classes
with prefixed names “fpo:” represent classes that appear in the factoid
ontology described at <u><a
href="http://factoid-dighum.kcl.ac.uk/">http://factoid-dighum.kcl.ac.uk/</a></u>,
and are here because they are explicitly referenced, and thereby semantically
linked to classes in the PoMS ontology.</li>
</ol>

<h4>1. <i>:ThingWithID</i>, and its subclasses</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>:ThingWithID</b> : All PoMS
     classes that directly or indirectly represent data in the PoMS database
     are subclasses of <i>:ThingWithID</i>.&nbsp; This reflects that fact that
     all data in the PoMS rdf dataset comes from a relational database, and thus
     all entities in it define a primary key which is made available in PoMS's
     RDF through the data property <i>:hasID</i>.</li>
 <li><b>:AuthorityList</b>: Authority
     lists have already been mentioned as one kind of “Thing with name”, and
     represent a list of things that might be thought of as functioning like
     what in library science is called an Authority File: “A compilation of
     records that describe the preferred form of headnames for use in a
     catalog” (<u><a
     href="https://definedterm.com/authority_file_also_authority_list">https://definedterm.com/authority_file_also_authority_list</a></u>).
     In PoMS not only bibliographic objects are formed into authority lists,
     but other classification schemes as well. <i>:TransactionType</i>, for
     example, has&nbsp; instances which represent various kinds of
     transactions that have appeared in PoMS’s charters. PoMS has a rather long
     list of different authority lists, so they are not listed in this class
     hierarchary figure.  However, they can all be seen in the class
     relationship diagram described in the next section of this document, and
     have text defining them attached to the PoMS ontology itself (as
     rfds:comment), and thus appear in the detailed PoMS ontology documentation
     pages generated by the <a
     href="https://www.poms.ac.uk/rdf/ontology/doc/">OWLdoc</a> tool. Furthermore, all
	 Authority List class instances have a name, which is provided with the <code>:hasName</code> property.</li>
 <li><b>:Factoid</b>: As
     described earlier, a factoid is the spot in an historical text where
     something is asserted about an historical person or persons.  It is a key
     concept of <a
     href="http://factoid-dighum.kcl.ac.uk/">factoid prosopography</a>.
     In PoMS factoids come in different kinds, and these different kinds are
     represented as subclasses of <i>:Factoid</i>. <i>:RelationshipFactoid</i>
     is an assertion about a relationship between two people, <i>:TitleOccupartionFactoid</i>
     is an assertion that a person had a title, or was involved in an
     occupation.  There are two kinds of factoids that involve possessions. <i>:PossessionFactoid</i>
     represents a simple assertion that someone owned something, whereas <i>:TransactionFactoid</i>
     represents a legal transaction between people of a possession. 
     Transactions, represented as TransactionFactoids, are the main business of most charters, of course.</li>
 <li><b>:Person</b>: of course,
     historical persons are a major class of object in any prosopography.  In
     the factoid model they represent the individuals that are referenced in
     factoids.  Subclassing of <i>:Person</i> is used first to associate a
     gender with an individual, <i>:HistoricalFemale</i> or <i>:HistoricalMale</i>.
     Often a group of people form an entity which is referenced in a charter.
     PoMS distinguishes between an <i>:HistoricalInstitution</i> which is a
     constituted historical entity, such as an abbey, and the more informal
     group of people (with both female and male individuals as members)
     classified as instances of a <i>:HistoricalMixedGenderGroup</i>.</li>
 <li><b>:Place</b>: Members of
     this class are geographic places. Geographic places are associated in
     various way to other classes in PoMS.  See the relationship diagram
     (below) and its discussion for more information.</li>
 <li><b>:Possession</b>: Since PoMS
     draws on historical legal charters as its primary historical source, possession
     play a large role in its data.  PoMS uses subclassing to categorise
     possessions into various types.  <i>:PossessionLand</i>, for instance, is a
     possession of a piece of land; <i>:PossessionOffice</i> is the possession
     of a particular office.</li>
 <li><b>:Reference</b>: In the
     factoid prosopography model a reference connects a factoid to something
     (in PoMS, either a Person or a Possession). It represents a particular
     reference to, say, a person in a particular context of one of the factoids
     drawn from a particular source.  Instances of this class have, therefore,
     a place to record how the reference to that person or possession is
     actually written in the source, and, where needed,
     what role the person played in the thing represented by the factoid.  There
     are two subclasses: <i>:PersonReference</i> (for a reference to a person),
     and <i>:PossessionReference</i> (for a reference to a possession).</li>
 <li><b>:Source</b>: Represents
     an historical primary source. In PoMS, this is usually the source from
     which charters (sometimes more than one) and Seals/Matrices are drawn.
     PoMS has two types of sources which are represented here as subclasses of
     <i>:Source</i>:
 <ul>
  <li><b>:Charter:</b> the
      principal source for data in PoMS is surviving legal charters.  Thus,
      this class has properties that provide information about each charter. In
      it one finds properties such as <i>:hasCharterType</i> which identifies
      which kind of charter it is, or <i>:isChirograph</i> which asserts
      whether or not the charter is a Chirograph. Several characteristics
      established for a charter by PoMS are recorded by the property <i>:hasOption</i>
      which can occur multiple times for a single charter. All charters have
      identifiers as “Hammond numbers” assigned to them.</li>
  <li><b>:Matrix</b>: In
      PoMS a matrix is the mould for a seal – the thing that is pressed against
      the hot wax in the sealing process.  Matrices, therefore, act as sources
      for historical information in their own right, and properties associated
      with the <i>:Matrix</i> class describe the characteristics for these
      matrix objects.</li>
 </ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>2. :<i>Thing…</i> classes</h4>

<p>A number of direct
subclasses of <i>owl:Thing</i> have names that start with the word “Thing”. 
All these subclasses (other than <i>:ThingWithID</i>, which has been described above) are
classes that are not directly expressed as relational database tables in their
own right, but contain properties that provide certain semantic functions that
more than one class/table make use of. In database terms, this function is provided by the provision of one or more attributes (table columns) that appear in more than one table, but in all contexts define the same kind of thing. The ones that appear in PoMS’s ontology
are listed here.</p>

<ul>
 <li><b>:ThingOrganisedHierarchically</b>: Any class
     which has members that can be organised hierarchically are subclasses of
     this class too, and share properties that support a hierarchical
     organisation of its instances – so that these instances can be organised
     as a conceptual tree.  In the figure, this class has not been opened to
     show its subclasses, but if it had been opened one would seem that in PoMS
     the <i>:Place</i> and  <i>:Possession</i> classes are subclasses of <i>ThingOrganisedHierarchically</i>,
     and therefore have a hierarchical organisation of their members. The
     properties that express this hierarchy derive from the “Nested Set”
     approach for representing hierarchies that can be mapped effectively to
     the relational data paradigm. See <a
     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model</a>.</li>
 <li><b>:ThingWithName</b>: About
     half of PoMS’s classes are subclasses of <i>:ThingWithName</i>, represent
     kinds of data that have a string of characters which can be categorised as
     a “name” for the thing. People of course, have names, so <i>:Person</i>
     appears as a subclass of <i>vocab:ThingWithName</i>. However, other
     things in PoMS have names too, and the other major kind of data are
     different kinds of Authority Lists (such as lists of Offices, lists of
     Praenomen, etc). <i>:ThingWithName</i> classes all have a data
     property <i>:hasName</i> – although in the :Person class <i>:hasName</i>
     is identified as a super-property of PoMS’s person display name identified
     in property <i>:hasDisplayName</i>.</li>
 <li><b>:ThingWithNotes</b>: In PoMS
     textual notes are short texts provided by the PoMS researchers that
     explain things (like classification decisions made by the PoMS project
     research team) to the PoMS user community. It is characterised by the <i>:hasNotes</i>
     property, which is thus shared by subclasses of the <i>:ThingWithNotes</i>
     superclass: <i>:Factoid</i>, <i>:Place</i>, <i>:PossessionPrivilege</i>, <i>:Source</i>,
     and two classes that, although not derived directly from PoMS’s relational
     database, are directly related to the handling of date information: <i>:Weekday</i>
     and <i>:Season</i>.</li>
 <li><b>:ThingThatCanBeOrdered</b>: When
     instances of a class are displayed as a list, some of these lists need to
     be presented in a specific order: for those lists the ordering provides
     significant semantic substance.  For these, PoMS researchers provided an
     ordering number in the <i>:hasOrderNo</i> property.  Subclasses that have
     this property are <i>:PersonReference</i> (for the ordering of witness
     lists in particular), <i>:ProAnimaGenericType</i>, <i>:SicutClauseType</i>.and
     the two classes that are directly related to the handling of date
     information :Weekday and :Season.</li>
 <li><b>:ThingReferencingPlace</b>: Several
     entity types make explicit reference to geographic place (:Place) through
     a :hasPlace property. Those entities are, thus, subclasses of
     :ThingReferencingPlace.  They are <i>:Charter</i>, <i>:Factoid</i>, <i>:PossessionPrivilege</i>
     and <i>:TitleType</i>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.a Classes for Dates</h4>

<p>Medieval Historians know that dates and
dating for materials in their sources are often complex constructs. PoMS’s
ontology has two classes that represent materials about dates and dating: <i>:ThingWithPossibleDateRange</i>
and <i>:ThingWithDatingInformation</i>.</p>

<p>For both these classes properties are
associated them that represent assertions about dating.  These properties will
be discussed shortly. These two classes act as superclasses for classes that
contain dating information that is represented by the properties that are associated with these classes.</p>

<p><b>:ThingWithPossibleDateRange</b><i>. </i>This class is very
straightforward, and has only a single property associated with it: <i>:hasPossibleDateRange</i>,
which is a string that represents, in human readable form, a date range. Its
subclasses (those classes that, therefore, make us of this property) are
:Factoid, :Person and :Source.</p>

<p><b>:ThingWithDatingInformation</b> is more complex,
and has :Factoid and :Source as its subclasses.  Thus, instances of these two
classes can express dating information about themselves using the set of
properties that <i>:ThingWithDatingInformation</i> provides:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dating
information is represented as a date range, specified in terms of a starting
and ending date. The date can be specified to different degrees of specificity:
sometimes only a year can be given, sometimes a year, month and day is
possible.  If there is no range needed, only the starting date (“from date”) is
specified.</li>

<li>The
two dates that specify the range are called the “from date” (starting date of
the range) and “to date” (ending date).</li>

<li>For the from date, several properties are provided:
<ul>
<li><i>:hasFromDay</i>, <i>:hasFromMonth</i>
and <i>:hasFromYear</i> specifies the day, month of year for the from date</li>

<li><i>:hasFromWeekday</i> is specified if
the source explicitly gives a weekday. This is expressed in the RDF as a member
of the <i>:Weekday</i> class, such as <i>:Sunday</i>.</li>

<li><i>:hasFromSeason</i> is specified if
the source explicitly gives a season. This is expressed as a member of the <i>:Season</i>
class, such as <i>:Spring</i>.</li>

<li><i>:hasFromModifier</i> and <i>:hasFromModifier2</i>
are used to provide two bits of “modifier text” for the date.  In PoMS, only
“cir” (for “circa”) has been used in :hasFromModifier, and “lat” (for "late") or
“ear” (for “early”), as in “late 1161” or “early 1302”.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>There are also
a set of properties for the “to date” that provide the same information as
the corresponding properties listed above for the “from date They have, not
surprisingly, the word “to” in each name replacing “from”; <i>:hasToday</i>,
<i>:hasToMonth</i>, and so on.</li>

<li><b>:hasDatingNotes</b>: generally, a
short bit of text that justifies the dating specified here, e.g.: “Death of
King David I × last year in which Walter de Bidun could have been chancellor.”</li>

<li><b>:hasFirmDate</b>: a representation
of the date in text as a “firm date”, e.g. “24 May 1153 X 8 April 1156”.</li>

<li><b>:hasFirmDayOnly</b>: indicates the thing has a weekday but no date</li>

<li><b>:hasProbableDate</b>: text that
describes a probable date, e.g. “prob. shortly after 24/May/1153”.</li>

<li><b>:isEitherOr</b>: indicates two possible dates or date ranges</li>

<li><b>:isFirmDat</b>e: indicates the date is a firm date</li>

<li><b>:isUndated</b>: indicates the document is undated or undateable</li>
</ul>

<p>You will have noted that not all the
classes in the hierarchical class figure are described above. Furthermore, only
a very limited number of associated properties are mentioned in this text. A
more detailed semantic description for classes and properties is given in the
detailed formal description of the ontology generated by OWLDoc and found <u><a
href="../ontology/doc/index.html">here</a></u>.</p>

<h3 id="relationships">Ontology Class Relationship Diagram</h3>
<p>The following figure presents all the
Classes in PoMS’s ontology and shows how they relate to each other through owl:ObjectProperties.</p>

<p><a href="images/ontology-diagram.png" target="blank"><img border=0 width=800 src="images/ontology-diagram.png"></a></p>

<p>When studying this figure, you should
first note that it is meant to show only a broad overview of the classes, and leaves
out many details. For example, no owl:DataProperties are shown in the diagram, and the
SubClassing hierarchy is not fully shown either. Nonetheless, a broad
overview is helpful if you are trying to grasp the structure overall.</p>

<p>First, about the legend (bottom  left corner). As it tells you:</p>

<ul>
 <li>the boxes represent Classes, and three colours are in use:
 <ul>
  <li>The green boxes represent classes
      from the FPO ontology (see <u><a
      href="http://factoid-dighum.kcl.ac.uk/">http://factoid-dighum.kcl.ac.uk/</a>)</u>.
      By connecting some of PoMS’s classes with classes in the FPO, we intend
      to show how the PoMS data works as a factoid prosopography.</li>
  <li>The red boxes represent classes that
      are authority lists.  As described above, authority list items are
      primarily lists of names for things that belong in the list.</li>
  <li>The blue boxes represent the major
      semantic classes in the PoMS ontology, which in turn represent the major
      semantic elements in the PoMS database data structure.</li>
 </ul></li>
 <li>the double-line arrows show SubClass-&gt;SuperClass
     connections between classes, with the arrow head placed at the SuperClass
     end of each connection. Properties associated with a SuperClass will also be
	 available to the SubClass.</li>
 <li>the single line arrows show
     connections between Classes defined by owl:ObjectProperties. The
     name of the property is shown on each line, and the arrow head end is the
     “range” part of the relationship.</li>
</ul>
<h4>A Guided Tour</h4>

<p>As its legend says, the class relationship diagram showing here 
shows the classes in the PoMS ontology as coloured boxes (representing
PoMS’s data Classes) with two types of arrows connecting them.&nbsp; In this
section, we will focus on the significance of the single line, named, arrows,
which present Class connections expressed by the <i>owl:ObjectProperty</i> mechanism. The
reader may have noted the “:” before class names in this diagram. In this context, this
implies the base URI prefix for PoMS’s ontology that applies to all the items

<p>In some the other parts of this documentation, this PoMS ontology URI is specified using
the prefix “vocab:”, although in the following discussion the <i>vocab:</i>
prefix is left out purely for the sake of compactness.</p>

<h5>Persons</h5>

<p>PoMS’s data is largely modelled as a
prosopographical project, so an important class is <i>:Person</i>, shown at the
top left side of the diagram.&nbsp; PoMS Persons have a rich set of <i>owl:DataProperties</i>,
listed in the section about :Person in the OWLDoc pages in <a href="../ontology/doc">https://www.poms.ac.uk/rdf/ontology/doc</a>,
but not shown here. However, one can see in this diagram that <i>:Person</i>
also connects to several other data classes. Here is a reproduction of the top
left corner of the relationship diagram above which focuses on the classes
directly related to Persons:</p>

<p><img border=0 width=520 src="images/person.png"></p>

<p>There are several things to note here:</p>
<ul>
<li>First,
PoMS’s :Person class is a subclass of FPO’s Person class. This tells us that one
of the direct connections between PoMS and the FPO is through its person class.</li>

<li>Shown above
the <i>:Person</i> class is a collection of six classes that represent types of
“persons” in PoMS, represented as subclasses of the more general <i>:Person</i>
class.  In the PoMS data almost all people are asserted to be members of one of
these subclasses, rather than :Person directly.</li>

<li>There are four kinds of OWL Data Properties that are associated with :Person, and
they are:
<ul>
<li><i>:hasFloruitLow</i> and
<i>:hasFloruitHi</i>, which together provide a general life date range for the person,</li>

<li><i>:hasMedievalGaelicForename</i>,
which specifies the historic Gaelic forename for the person, as specified in
the <i>:MedievalGaelicForename</i> authority list, and</li>

<li><i>:hasModernGaelicForename</i>,
which specifies that one of the names in <i>:ModernGaelicForename</i> is the
modern-day representation of this person’s name.</li>
</ul></ul>

<p>For example, one of the triples one can find in the data set is:</p>

<code>&lt;<a href="https://www.poms.ac.uk/rdf/entity/Person/10">https://www.poms.ac.uk/rdf/entity/Person/10</a>&gt;<br>
:hasModernGaelicForename<br>
&lt;<a href="https://www.poms.ac.uk/rdf/entity/ModernGaelicforename/38">https://www.poms.ac.uk/rdf/entity/ModernGaelicforename/38</a>&gt;
</code>

<p>Where <code>…./Person/10</code> is the URI for a
particular person, in this case <i>Reginald, bishop of Ross (d.1213)</i>, and
<code>…/ModernGaelicforename/38</code> is the authority list entry for <i>Raghnall</i>.</p>

<h5>Factoids</j5>

<p>Since PoMS is a factoid prosopography, it
is perhaps not surprising that most of the assertions about persons in PoMS appear
in the form of factoids.&nbsp; The bottom right side of the relationship
diagram focuses on classes related to factoids:</p>

<p><img border=0 width=602 src="images/factoid.png"></p>

<p>One can find the <i>:Factoid</i> class in
the top centre of this diagram. Factoids say things about people, and the <i>:Reference</i>
class provides the linking mechanism between factoids and persons. <i>:Reference</i> is described below (and
as one will see there, in PoMS <i>:Reference</i> also provides links to possessions as well as persons).
</p>

<p>There are several subclasses of <i>:Factoid</i>
that reflect the different kinds of factoids that PoMS holds:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>:RelationshipFactoid</i> asserts personal
relationships that the sources identify between two people (e.g. "William
Boswell <u>is husband of</u> Isabel of Merlington"). This is essentially the
same as FPO’s <i>fpo:RelationshipFactoid</i>.  The particular relationship
being asserted is provided through the <i>:hasRelationship</i> property, which
connects to the <i>:RelationshipType</i> authority list. Relationships in <i>:RelationshipType</i>
have been given a classification by PoMS, and this is in <i>:RelationshipMetaType</i>.</li>

<li><i>:TitleOccupationFactoid</i> asserts title and
occupations that the sources have associated with their historical persons.
Titles are listed in the <i>:TitleType</i> authority list and are linked to a
particular factoid through its <i>:hasTitleType</i> property.</li>

<li><i>:FactoidInvolvingPossession</i>: Possessions are
prominent (see discussions about them below) in PoMS, and this is not
surprising given that the historical sources for PoMS are primarily legal
charters and charter-like documents.  Possessions are not only physical
objects, but rights and privileges of various kinds. There are two ways in
which possessions are mentioned in these charters:
<ul>
<li><i>:TransactionFactoid</i>: In this kind of
factoid possessions are mentioned as part of a legal transaction.  Legal
transactions are the mainstay of PoMS’s sources, so the structure for the <i>:TransactionFactoid</i>
is rich, with many properties involved.  You can see this in the number of
authority lists associated with the <i>:TransactionFactoid</i> class, and,
(although they are not shown on this diagram) there are many data properties
also.</li>

<li><i>:PossessionFactoid</i>: Sometimes a
possession is mentioned (in passing, as it were) in a charter without being
involved in a transaction.  These references are captured in <i>:PossessionFactoids</i>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="references">References</h5>

<p>The factoid has been defined as “a spot in
a source where something is said about a person or persons”. Within the idea of
a factoid, then, is the idea of a direct reference to a person in the text, and
this idea is what is represented by <i>:Reference</i>. Here is the portion of
the relationship diagram that represents it:</p>

<p><img border=0 width=602 src="images/reference.png"></p>

<p><i>:Reference</i> is an idea that is present in
FPO as well, so PoMS’s :Reference class is asserted to be a subclass of FPO’s
<i>:Reference</i> class (see discussion about Reference from FPO’s point of view <a
href="https://factoid-dighum.kcl.ac.uk/fpo-factoid-prosopography-ontology/fpo-references/">here</a>).
As in FPO, a property links a <i>:Reference</i> to a <i>:Factoid</i>.  In PoMS
the link is expressed through property <i>:hasFactoid</i>, and the link can be
thought of as asserting a kind of ownership: a factoid can be considered to own
one or more references.  Note that PoMS’s <i>:hasFactoid</i> is an inverse
relation to FPO’s property link <i>fpo:hasReference</i>.</p>

<p>A reference arises out of a particular
spot in a text where a name of someone is recorded, so <i>:hasOriginalText</i>
is the property for :Reference that allows PoMS to record how the name was
recorded there.  The PoMS team did not record this for every reference, instead
it was used primarily to record ones that were unusual, unclear, or perhaps
controversial. PoMS’s <i>:hasOriginalText</i> property is a subproperty of
FPO’s <i>fpo:hasNameInSourceAs</i>.</p>

<p>In PoMS the idea of Reference as it is
represented in FPO is expanded to include not only references to historical
persons, but references to possessions too. Thus, there are two subclasses to
<i>:Reference</i>:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>:PersonReference</i> asserts the
connection between the factoid and a person represented as <i>:Person</i>. This is
done with its property <i>:referencesPerson</i>, which is a subproperty of
FPO’s <i>fpo:reference</i>. Note that factoids often refer to more than one
person, and if so, each person is likely to have a particular role in what the
factoid represents.  Thus, there is a property <i>:hasRole</i> for <i>:PersonReference</i>
that asserts the particular role for this person in this factoid, by pointing
at one of the roles in the authority list <i>:Role</i>.</li>

<li><i>:PossessionReference</i> asserts the
connection between the factoid and a possession represented as :Possession.
This is done through its property <i>:referencesPossession</i>. PoMS did not record a concept parallel to :Role for possessions.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Sources</h5>

<p>Historical primary sources are the objects
of research in a factoid prosopography project such as PoMS.  They appear in
the class relationship diagram in the upper right corner:</p>

<p><img border=0 width=601 src="images/source.png"></p>

<p>The PoMS ontology <i>:Source</i> class is
a subclass of FPO’s <i>fpo:Source</i> class.</p>

<p>As shown in the Class Hierarchy discussion
earlier, PoMS has two kinds of sources.  Overwhelmingly, the most prominent kind of
source is the legal charter (represented through the <i>:Charter</i> subclass),
but the seal matrices also provide an historical source as well (<i>:Matrix</i>
subclass).</p>

<ul>
<li>A
<i>:Source</i> is written in a language, and its <i>:hasLanguage</i> property
will assert this, and links to the :Language authority list.</li>

<li>PoMS also classifies sources according to a grantor category, and this is specified
by the <i>:hasGrantorCategory</i> property.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both <i>:Matrix</i> and <i>:Charter</i> have a number of
data properties which allow information about them to be recorded, and most of these are
not shown here.  Of these, however, of particular interest is the Hammond Number classification
scheme for charters <i>:hasHammondNumber</i> and other properties with names
beginning “hasHammond…”.</p>

<p><i>:Matrix</i> instances can record the matrix
shape through the <i>:hasShape</i> property.</p>

<p>A <i>:Charter</i> instance is assigned a charter
type, which is recorded with the <i>:hasCharterType</i> property. Each instance may
have one or more optional characteristic connected to it, which is recorded
through one or more instances of the <i>:hasCharterOption</i> property.</p>

<h5>Possessions</h5>

<p>Possessions are prominent in PoMS due to
its orientation towards legal charters.  The structure associated with them is
rather straightforward:</p>

<p><img border=0 width=602 src="images/possession.png"></p>

<p>Possessions are associated with the legal
charter sources through their references in Factoids, and that is shown in the
right side of this diagram.  The <i>:PossessionReference</i> class is a subclass of
<i>:Reference</i>, and uses <i>:referencesPossession</i> property to point to a particular
<i>:Possession</i>.</p>

<p>Any particular possession, in turn, is
associated with one of the subclasses of <i>:Possession</i>, which group possessions
into 9 categories, ranging from unfree persons, to privileges (such as the
right to hold a fair), and to land, plus several others (as shown).</p>

<h5>Places</h5>

<p>Geographical places are recorded in PoMS,
and are all associated with a particular area of land.  <i>:Place</i> is
associated with a range of different classes of objects:</p>

<p><img border=0 width=601 src="images/place.png"></p>

<p>Several things to note about <i>:Place</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place is an authority list in its own right.</li>

<li>Although
not evident here, Place is a <i>:ThingOrganisedHierarchically</i>, and thus allows its items to be organised hierarchically, so
that one place can be indicated to be geographically inside another (Glasgow Cathedral is
inside Glasgow, for example)</li>

<li><i>:Place</i> is referenced
from many other classes through the <i>:hasPlace</i> property.  Classes with
the <i>:hasPlace</i> property are also members of the <i>:ThingReferencingPlace</i>
class.</li>

<li>Many places, but not all, have an associated geographic point, expressed as Longitude and Latitude in
two ways: (i) through the <i>:hasGeographicLongitude</i> and <i>:hasGeographicLatitude</i>
properties, and (ii) through the <i>:hasGeoData</i> property, which gives the location
of the point using wktLiteral notation, e.g. “<code>POINT(55.953 -3.189)</code>”. Even for
places which might be thought of as better represented as an area rather than a
point (e.g. cities, or counties), PoMS has only a point coordinate.</li>
</li>

<li>The wktLiteral string associated with the <i>:hasGeoData</i> property is given
the datatype of <code>geo:wktLiteral</code>. This makes it available to be
used as data in queries involving rdf4j’s implementation of GeoSPARQL. (About GeoSPARQL in rdf4j see
pages at <a
href="https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j-doc/blob/master/doc/programming/06-geosparql.adoc">GitHub</a>
and <a
href="http://docs.rdf4j.org/programming/#_geosparql">rdfj4</a> itself).</li>
