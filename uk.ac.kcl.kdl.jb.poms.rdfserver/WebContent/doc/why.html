      <h1 class="w3-text-blue" id="top">Why PoMS as RDF?</h1>
<p>According to Wikipedia (page: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">Linked Data</a>), Tim Berners Lee
coined the term &quot;linked data&quot; in 2006 in a document about the
Semantic Web project. Nonetheless Wikipedia goes on to cite Bizer, Heath and
Berners-Lee's 2009 paper entitled &quot;Linked Data: The Story So Far&quot; as a
source for its opening definition of Linked data:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;a method of publishing
structured data so that it can be interlinked and become more useful through
semantic queries. It builds upon standard Web technologies such as HTTP, RDF
and URIs, but rather than using them to serve web pages for human readers, it
extends them to share information in a way that can be read automatically by
computers. This enables data from different sources to be connected and
queried.&quot;</blockquote>

<h3 id="about">About PoMS</h3>
<p>Why is Linked Data relevant to the PoMS project? First of
all, I believe Linked and Open Data principles are particularly relevant to
PoMS because PoMS is a prosopography, and, generally speaking, I believe that
published prosopography offers an almost ideal kind of research that could be
expressed as linked data. There are two senses in which prosopography connects
with linked data's central principles. First, because a prosopography aims to
develop the identity of their historical persons in a way that crosses multiple
historical sources, these identified historical people act, by their very
nature, as a kind of interlinking between these different sources. Second, a
prosopography is, at least potentially, a global object &#x2014; something used by other
researchers throughout the world as a source for identities for historical
people. The people-as-entities in a prosopography ideally have a global reach
and can thus play a part in the Global Graph that web folk, and those in the
Semantic Web and Linked Data in particular, talk about. For these reasons, it
seems to me that a prosopography forms the basis for a particularly rich and
interesting Linked Data kind of publication.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the <i>People of Medieval Scotland</i> (PoMS), like DDH/CCH's many other prosopographical projects, is constructed
based on a representation of its materials in the form of highly structured
data. Indeed, like DDH/CCH's other structured prosopographies, PoMS is built on
top of that quintessential highly structured paradigm: the relational database,
and as a result, PoMS's historical research work has been already expressed in
terms of entities, attributes and relationships as they are thought of in the
relational data model. Since the Linked Data model is also based on the idea of
representing materials in the form of highly structured data that is accessible
globally, PoMS's highly structured database would appear to fit well with it.</p>

<p>Finally, unlike the other structured data prosopography which has been expressed by DDH/KDL
in Semantic Web's RDF technology, DPRR (<a href="http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf">http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf</a>) PoMS is
in fact created using the factoid prosopography paradign (Bradley 2017) as one of its fundamental semantic principles.
Indeed, it is explicitly connected to the Factoid Prosopography Ontology described in Bradley 2017 through its own
ontology.</p> 

<h3 id="why">Why a PoMS RDF Server?</h3>
<p>We have already said that PoMS is built upon the relational
database &#x2014; and called this the "quintessential structured data paradigmâ€. Here,
however, we are talking about a linked data or semantic web representation of
PoMS's materials, and although both linked data/semantic web technologies and
relational database technologies are built upon a shared basic conception of
highly structured data, they are not the same. What, then, is necessary to turn
PoMS's already existing database-like structured materials into a publication that
fits the similar-but-different Linked Data model?Â  In order to think about this
most usefully, we need to understand the fundamental principles of Linked Data.</p>

<p>Tim Berners-Lee gave a presentation on linked data at the
TED 2010 conference. In it, he restated the linked data principles as three
&quot;extremely simple&quot; rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;All kinds of conceptual things, they have names now that start
with HTTP.</li>

<li>I get important information back. I will get back some data in a
standard format which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know
about that thing, about that event.</li>

<li>I get back that information it's not just got somebody's height
and weight and when they were born, it's got relationships. And when it has
relationships, whenever it expresses a relationship then the other thing that
it's related to is given one of those names that starts with HTTP.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>More formally, Bizer, Heath and Berners-Lee's 2009 paper,
mentioned earlier, specify four criteria that Berners-Lee had described as a
"set of 'rules' for publishing data on the Web" in a way that all published
data becomes part of a single global data space. These four principles are
presented succinctly in Wikipedia's "Linked Data" entry:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use URIs as names for things</li>

<li>Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names</li>

<li>When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (RDF,
SPARQL)</li>

<li>Include links to other URIs, so that they can discover more things.</li>
</ol>
<p>To at least some extent, rules one and two of these four seem to be met already by
PoMS's existing web browser oriented web application at URL <a href="https://www.poms.ac.uk/">https://www.poms.ac.uk/</a>.
Rule one, for example: there is one publishable URL provided by the browser-oriented web
application for each person in PoMS, and it is a RESTful one (definition of
RESTful URL's see Wikipedia's definition
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">here</a>). An example
from PoMS would be the URL for Abraham, Bishop of Dunblane (fl.1210×14-1220×25):
<a href="https://www.poms.ac.uk/record/person/749/">https://www.poms.ac.uk/record/person/749/</a>.This URL, then,
could be interpreted as rule 1's "URI" acting as a kind of name for its person.
Furthermore, if the existing web app is directly presented with this person's
URL, the application will return back an HTML page containing the information
PoMS has about that person, you can see this happening when one clicks on the Bishop's URL shown above.
Thus, as rule 2 requires, anyone with WWW access can
use this HTTP URI to look up that PoMS person. Furthermore, the generated PoMS
page provides, as rule 3 says, "useful information" about the entity it refers
to &#x2014; although, of course, the material is presented as an HTML page in a form
suitable for presentation by a web browser and is not delivered using the
semantic web standards of RDF. Finally, (rule 4) these generated web pages do
in fact contain links to other URIs within PoMS.</p>

<p>So, what is missing from the existing PoMS web application
that is needed to make it more fully into a Linked Data application? The key
issue can be found in the second half of Wikipedia's definition of linked data
&#x2014; items 3 and 4. As Bizer, Heath and Berners-Lee say, to operate as Linked
Data, the material has to presented "in a way that can be read automatically by
computers." They then go on to say that this enables data from different
sources to be "appropriately connected and queried.&quot;  With the current
"browser oriented" web application at www.poms.ac.uk the material is presented in terms of a HTML
web page suitable for reading by a human user, rather than in the form that explicitly expresses the formal
structured data. Of course, one <i>can</i> apply techniques called "screen scraping" to extract
the data from the presented web pages, but screen scraping is broadly
understood by its practitioners as awkward to do, and prone to error. Thus,
when presented as a set of HTML web pages, PoMS's data cannot readily be
processed, as data, by computers, and cannot readily be used as a source to be
connected, as data, with other sources. This is why Bizer, Heath and
Berners-Lee attach an explicit reference to RDF in their rule 3. RDF is
described in its own documentation as a representation of a world-wide
"graph-based data model" (section 1.1, https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/). By
presenting the PoMS data in RDF, a language specifically designed for interlinking
between data that can operate potentially world-wide, and is then available for
further computer processing, one can present PoMS's research materials as a
more satisfactory Linked Data source. </p>

<h3 id="building">Building the RDF</h3>
<p>The work described and referenced in these pages does
exactly this: it turns PoMS's relational database which holds most of the intellectual
work embodied in PoMS into RDF, and then uses pieces of RDF-related technology
to deliver RDF over the internet to anyone that wants to use it. However, the
work done here goes further than just this. In addition:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, it provides access to RDF data using the query mechanism
specifically designed for selecting and processing RDF data: SPARQL (<a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/">http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/</a>). 
By providing a SPARQL endpoint, we are allowing users to select and order data
in PoMS in any way that a SPARQL query allows (subject, of course, to
length-of-time limitations for processing), and this, in turn, allows for a
much broader range of querying than PoMS's current browser-oriented web
application data selection methods support.</li>

<li>Second, the work has resulted in the creation of a Semantic Web ontology
for PoMS &#x2014; a formal definition of the structure of PoMS's data. Digital
Ontologies are important elements in the whole framework of Semantic Web
technologies that go beyond the more modest aims of Linked Data. They
provide mechanisms that, because of their formalism, allow the computer on its
own to better exploit the link between the structure of PoMS's data and its
meaning in the world. And, indeed, PoMS's ontology does allow some of
the Semantic Web's ideas related to automatic reasoning to be exploited against
this data. However, an ontology for PoMS has a further significant different
purpose: it makes it easier for human users to understand what kind of
information is in the set of RDF data for PoMS, and how it fits together.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, the work described here resulted in several products:</p>
<ol>
<li>The PoMS MySQL relational database was translated into a sequence of RDF
triples,</li>

<li>The triples were loaded into an RDF repository, and made available to the WWW via a
server,</li>

<li>PoMS's
server was extended to support a SPARQL query frontend (a so-called SPARQL
endpoint), and</li>

<li>The structure behind RDF's triples has been defined in a basic Semantic Web OWL
ontology.</li>
</ol>

<p>The rest of this PoMS RDF server documentation site talks more about this work, and has three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Using PoMS's RDF Server:</i> First, there is guidance on how
to use the PoMS RDF Linked Data server to get at, and query, PoMS materials (Tab "<a href="using.html">Using the Server</a>" (above)),</li>

<li><i>PoMS Ontology:</i> then Tab "<a href="ontology.html">PoMS Ontology</a>" presents an overview of PoMS's ontology. In addition to this, there is also a web-site presentation
of the ontology that was automatically generated by OWLDoc <a href="/rdf/ontology/doc">here</a>, and</li>

<li><i>SPARQL Examples</i>: finally, the tab <a href="sparql.html">SPARQL Examples</a> provides a few examples of SPARQL queries against PoMS data to help you get started creating your own queries that serve your interests.</li>
</ul>
