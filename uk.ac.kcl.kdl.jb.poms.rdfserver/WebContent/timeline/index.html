<h3>Using DPRR's SPARQL Interface for data</h3>
<hr />
<p>You can find <a href="makeConsulTimeline.py">here</a> a small Python script which demonstrates how the DPRR SPARQL interface could be used to fetch data
for presentation in a way different from that which is readily available from the DPRR browser-oriented web application.</p>
<p>In this example, a SPARQL query is run to fetch all instances of data about appointments to the office of Consul which
involve a DPRR person for which a tribal association has been provided.  The script takes this data and uses Google Graphs
to generate a set of timelines which show how the consul office has been distributed between the different tribes over the
period of time represented by DPRR.</p>
<p>The page that the script generates is included in this folder, and is available <a href="consuls.html">here</a>.</p>
