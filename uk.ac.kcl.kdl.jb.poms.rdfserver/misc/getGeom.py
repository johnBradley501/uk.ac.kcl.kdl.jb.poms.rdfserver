# this Python script reads the field "geom" in PoMS's MySQL database table pomsacc_place
# and generates a Turtle RDF file that creates a sequence of triples that represent this
# data as RDF -- making use of the opengis specifaction that is, in turn, supported by
# rdf4j.

# This script connects to the MySQL database, and so must invoke and then use the connector
# you have in your Python installation.  I happen to have the, now rather old, MySQLdb module
# for this purpose and use it here.  If you have the newer version, you will probably have to
# make the, hopefully relatively minor, changes to the script to make it work.

# You'll probably need to modify the values of the variables at the front of the script to
# specify how the connection to the MySQL database is to be made, and to indicate where the
# file that this script creates is to be stored.
